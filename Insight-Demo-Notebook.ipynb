Multidimensional scaling allows a two dimensional representation of the data by respecting the original distances of the high-dimensional space. In this case for my graphs, countries that have a higher correlation of trade products (stronger ties) are represented closer to each other. Countries that have a lower correlation are farther apart from each other. This is a nice way of visually representing this data because for my work my hypothesis that countries that have higher similarities in their trade behavior are more likely to experience crises in similar time periods"
